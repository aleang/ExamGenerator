# Exam Generator (2015)
This application creates generated exam scripts based on the format required. The generated script is an HTML document ready for printing. Questions and their Options can be ordered randomised. The input is a textfile which must follow the format in order to work properly. See the [help page](http://aleang.github.io/ExamGenerator/) for further instructions. 

I like programming in Java :coffee: so you will need JRE or JDK installed. The runnable 'JAR' file is located in the dist/ folder.
